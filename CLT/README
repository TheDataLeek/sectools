This tool is intended to assist individuals interested in learning cryptography. Cryptographic algorithms included are RSA, Vign√©re cipher, Caesar cipher, Ubchi, with others to come. Code has been written in python and commented for learning ease.  

For extended information on the ciphers as well as the programs, see www.will-farmer.com/projects

To install, find a suitable location on your hard drive for the source code and move the project to there.

To run the program:
    Open the terminal application, located under utilities
    Navigate to the program directory  
        mac/linux users: cd /Users/<user>/<location>
        for example: cd /Users/Robert/Documents/CLT
    Type ./baseconv.py or the name of any of the modules you wish to run
    Another method is to run them from a higher folder. This allows you to identify files fer encryption that are not in the same directory.
        example: ./CLT-1/Encryption_Tools/CLT_RSA.py -f ./test_file.txt

    The modules are not case-sensitive but if data is entered incorrectly it will quit
    File names MUST have the extension included in encryption and decryption
